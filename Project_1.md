## Description
Fight enemies to death death in series of 1-1 battles. After defeating all of his minions, you'll have to face the boss.
***
## Getting Started:

* I'm using Trello to list out steps needed to make the game.
* Then I'll use psuedo code to build the MVP of the game.
* The game will start out with random attack defense actions on a turn based platform.
* If more time is available, I will try to implement real time reactions
